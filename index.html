        <p>Lions are the only cats that live in groups.
         A group, or pride, can be up to 30 lions, depending on how much food and water is available.
         Female lions are the main hunters.      
         A lion's roar can be heard up to eight kilometres away.
         Lions scent mark their territory, using their wee, to create a border.</p>
